an application that runs a java themed quiz game. This app runs in the browser and fetures dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code. The goal was to create a dynamic game that responds to the user either correctly or incorrectly answering questions by telling them whether it was correct or incorrect and then either adding or subtracting points based on whether they were correct or incorrect. If the user gets the question incorrect they also lost five seconds off of their time. At the end there score is calculated based on the questions they answered right and there time remaining in the end. The hiscores are then saved to local storage and displayed for each iteration of the game in the browser.
